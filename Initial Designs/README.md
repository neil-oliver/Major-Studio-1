### Initial Design

This design has been created from the sketch below, which was one of three initials designed detailed [here](https://github.com/neil-oliver/Major-Studio-1/tree/master/Initial%20Sketches).

### Accessing the MET API Data
#### Script.js
The code in this file has been adapted from the starting code found [here](https://github.com/readyletsgo/msdv-major-studio-1-fa19).

#### Index.html
So far there is not a lot here! The HTML document was simply used to call the .js file, and allow the use of the console.
The data was removed from the console manually and manipulated in Excel and Illustrator.
