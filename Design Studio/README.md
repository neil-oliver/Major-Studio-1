### [Frontex: EU’s Deportation Machine](https://vimeo.com/351673775)

### Honorable Mentions
Personal Project - [Marble Butterflies](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/marble-butterflies)([Design Process](http://www.datasketch.es/february/)). 

#### Why?
The project is purely about creating something beautiful from random data. It relates back to Nadieh's original goal of creating "Something that wouldn’t look bad hanging on a wall."

## Class discussion
- Look through Nadieh's portfolio [HERE](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/). What common design themes do you spot?
- Some of Nadieh's designs put form over function (or the form decision is purely for aesthetic value). Is it acceptable to pick a less-optimized visualization method if it maintains the user interest more?

## Going down the rabbit hole
Nadieh's website has so much information about her projects and process, but she has compiled a [huge list](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/resources/learning-data-visualization) a resources for learning and discussing data visualization topics that will be very useful to any aspiring data vis artist. Her [blog](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/blog/) is also an amazing resource. Take a deep breath, you could spend months looking through all of this...
