### Aquisition of artwork during / after an artists life time.
Population piramid style chart to compare the amount of aquisitions made of artists that are dead / alive.
Each bar is broken down into the number of aquisitions in each department or medium.

#### Possible Changes
The chart could be adapted to be more specific in terms of focusing on one particular department and showing the number of aqusitions of each artist.

### Popularity of seasons through different artistic medium
Spider chart showing the percentage of 'seasonal' pieces that focus on each season.


#### Possible Changes / Upgrade
The chart would be more interesting if it could be adapated to focus on what month a piece was started or focused on, but i am not confident this information would be readily available.
