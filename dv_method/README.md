# Scatter Plot
*(scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram)*

## Description / Use
A scatter plot is a visualization method designed to show the relationship between two 
(control and dependent) variables. This is achieved by plotting the two points on a horizontal (X) and veretical (Y) axis using a [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). Additional variables can be included through the adaptation of color, shape and size.
