# Scatter Plot
*(scatterplot, scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram)*

## Description / Use
A scatter plot is a visualization method designed to show the relationship (if any) between two variables. This is achieved by plotting the two points on a horizontal (X) and veretical (Y) axis using a [cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). Additional variables can be included through the adaptation of color, shape and size.

## History

## Gathering / Plotting Data
Either
- One control parameter (independent variable) and one dependent variable (correlation and causation).
  - If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the control parameter.
  - Dependent variables depend on the values of independent variables.
  - Dependent variable will usually be plotted along the vertical axis.  
Or
- Two independent variables (correlation, not causation).
  - Either variable can be plotted on either axis



## Examples
### Basic

### Use of Shapes

### Inclusion of Color

### Third Axis (Scatter Plot Matrix)
For a set of data variables (dimensions) X1, X2, ... , Xk, the scatter plot matrix shows all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single view with multiple scatterplots in a matrix format.

### Use of Interactivitiy

### Radial Scatter Plots

### Bubble Charts

#### Differences from Bubble Chart
While many bubble charts use a scatter plot format with the addition of changing the size of the plot poonts to indicate an additional variable, not all bubble charts need to be constrained by the X/Y axis format of a scatter plot.
